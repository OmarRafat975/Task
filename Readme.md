# GIT Repo
in this file we will learn how to make a local git repo then upload it online

> ## Steps :
 - create file
 - open your git bash
 - type the code `git init` to initiate a new git repo
 - then add file and do what you want with it
 - then track the file with `git add filename.ext`
 - after you finish editing commit the file `git commit "commit message"`
 - create a new repo in github
 - copy the link to this repo then connect to it
 
   `git remote add https://github.com/example/example.git`
 - rename the branch to have the same branch name to push
  
   `git branch -M main`
- then push the repo to the empty repo 
  
    `git push -u origin main`
